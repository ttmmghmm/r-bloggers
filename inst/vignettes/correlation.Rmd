```{r max correlation}
install.packages('acepack')
library(acepack)
x = -100 : 100
y = (100^2 - x^2)^0.5    # let's make a circle
cor(x, y)
# [1,] 0     # a circular line has zero linear correlation

cor(x, y, method='spearman')
# [1,] 0     # and zero rank correlation

argmax = ace(x, y)
cor(argmax$tx, argmax$ty)

```



This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
